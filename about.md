# About SmartPath Data

I’m Steve, a data consultant who helps small teams and solo founders get more from their data without the complexity.

With experience across Power BI, automation, and practical workflow design, I focus on solutions that are clear, reliable, and easy to maintain.  
Clients work with me because I explain things simply, build things that last, and genuinely care about making their day‑to‑day work easier.

If you want a friendly expert who can help you untangle data problems and build tools that actually work, you’re in the right place.
