# Services

I help businesses make better use of their data through clear reporting, automation, and practical problem‑solving.

## Power BI Development
Clean, reliable dashboards built around the questions your business actually needs to answer.  
I focus on clarity, performance, and long‑term maintainability.

From PowerShell to Power Automate, I build solutions that save time every day.

## Workflow Fixes & Troubleshooting
If something in your reporting process is slow, fragile, or frustrating, I help diagnose the root cause and fix it properly.

## One‑to‑One Support
For founders and small teams who need an expert on call.
