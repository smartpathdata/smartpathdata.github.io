title: Power BI: Start Simple, Scale Later

Power BI is incredibly powerful, but many dashboards fail because they try to do too much too soon.

## Start with the questions
A dashboard should answer a small number of important questions clearly.  
Everything else is noise.

## Build a clean data model
A simple, well‑structured model beats a complex one every time.  
It’s easier to maintain, easier to explain, and far less likely to break.

## Add complexity only when needed
Once the basics are solid, you can layer in more advanced logic.  
Scaling works best when the foundation is clean.

Power BI doesn’t need to be complicated to be effective — it just needs to be intentional.
