title: Why Your Reports Keep Breaking (and How to Fix Them)
date: 2024-01-12

If your reports feel fragile, slow, or unpredictable, you’re not alone.  
Most reporting issues come from the same handful of root causes — and the good news is that they’re all fixable.

## 1. Too many manual steps
Every manual step is a chance for something to go wrong.  
Automating even small parts of the process can dramatically improve reliability.

## 2. Inconsistent data sources
If your inputs change shape, your outputs will break.  
A simple validation step can prevent hours of troubleshooting.

## 3. Over‑complicated spreadsheets
Spreadsheets grow organically until they become impossible to maintain.  
Sometimes the best fix is simplifying the workflow entirely.

A little structure goes a long way.  
If your reporting feels fragile, it’s usually a sign the process needs a tune‑up — not a rebuild.
